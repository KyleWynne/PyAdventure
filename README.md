# Guide For Contributors
Find a requested adventure or create your own around a python concept that you think is important for people to learn, to keep the adventures cohesive in their structure follow these guidelines when designing:

1) Make sure users are given a chance to read a full explanation of the topic and are able to access the explanation when they are struggling
2) There are two types of questions asked a free response question that needs exact syntax or a multiple choice question
3) Make sure questions are in blocks and if a user gets one of the questions wrong they restart the block of questions untill they get all of them correct
4) Have fun with the adventures you write but to avoid user confusion have the un named main charachter wander into a dangerous situation that they must escape by correctly answering questions
5) these stories can be as detailed as you prefer just make sure to give a wholistic approach to the subject you are teaching
6) Please link the issue to the pull request so that we can close issues efficiently and claim issues in the comments under them, a moderator will assign that issue and it is first come first serve
7) Lastly, Have Fun with Your Story
